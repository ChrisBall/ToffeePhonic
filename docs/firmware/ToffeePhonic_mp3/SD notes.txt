The MP3 version of toffeephonic expects an SD card loaded with instrument samples.

Each MP3 needs to be in a folder - instrumentNumber/noteNumber.mp3

e.g.

00/01.mp3

127/64.mp3

Instruments can be 0-127.

Note Numbers can be 0-127.



In future versions, it may be that the folder can be named, e.g.

Guitar/37.mp3

and the toffeePhonic will scan for and scroll through folder names instead of numbers.
