# Files for laser cutting

These files are for laser cutting an enclosure for ToffeePhonic in 3mm material. Not strictly required to work, but this will help your instrument look smart and be a lot more durable. If you don't know anything about this, try contacting your local hackspace for help, or failing that, a laser cutting service near you.


If you're familiar with this tool, your machine need to be set up to etch the red, cut the black strokes, then cut the blue stroke. Using no kerf offset on the black strokes is best.


As mentioned in the build instructions, there is a version of the enclosure that incorporates a mic clip, so the instrument can be attached to a stand for easy use.
