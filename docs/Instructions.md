## Instrument Instructions


# General Operating Notes

The beam will operate best in low light (preferably complete darkness, but I realise that's rarely possible). The sensor used detects pulses from an infra-red laser, and as such may perform poorly in scenarios with incandescent or intense lighting, such as spotlights or daylight.

The sensor used in this device is the VL53L1X time-of-flight sensor.

This is a prototype device and may not always behave as expected. If you have any issues or feedback, open n isasue.


# Power

The instrument can be powered from a USB port or standard 5V micro USB phone charger.


# Audio/MIDI Out

A line out/headphone out is provided for connection to headphones or external speakers. IF the device is connected by USB to a computer, it should register as a general MIDI device, and can be used to control instruments in Garage Band or similar DAW software.


# Menu

The menu options can be navigated with the ↑ and ↓ buttons. The options are:

-Scale: You can change the musical key by pressing the ← and → buttons, and the type of musical scale with the ⏺ button.

-Notes: How many notes from the selected scale to play over the range. Can be altered with the ← and → buttons.

-Min Dist(cm): Where the sensing range of the instrument begins. This is where the lowest note of the scale will begin. Can be altered with the ← and → buttons.

-Max Dist(cm): Where the sensing range of the instrument ends. This is where the highest note of the scale will end. Can be altered with the ← and → buttons. There is a maximum of 100cm, but this distance may be affected by ambient lighting.

-Inst: and Bank: The instrument can be selected with the ← and → buttons. A full list of the numbered instruments can be found at:
[https://soundprogramming.net/file-formats/general-midi-instrument-list/](https://soundprogramming.net/file-formats/general-midi-instrument-list/). Bank 0 is the default instrument list. Selecting bank 1 with the ⏺ button will alow you to access more percussive sounds.

-Volume: Raises and lowers the volume, with the minimum being 0 and the maximum being 127. Can be altered with the ← and → buttons.

The device will save any changes you make in the menu, and revert to the last used settings upon restart.
