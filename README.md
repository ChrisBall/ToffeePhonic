ToffeePhonic is an open-source range sensing instrument. It measures distance using a Time-Of-Flight (TOF) sensor and converts the range into music with it's onboard synthesiser, or sends MIDI out over USB.

The instructions here should contain everything you need to build your own, including a bill of materials, laser cutting files, build guide, code and instructions for use. This project is probably not suitable for complete beginners (at the moment).
